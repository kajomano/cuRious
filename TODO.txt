NOT STARTED       (1) Unified way of handling dimensions. Dimension checks
                   +  should be independent of pseudo-transposes. The system
                   +  should naturally be expandable to 3D arrays.
                   +
NOT STARTED       (2) In-place pseudo-transposes for non-full rank arrays.

NOT STARTED       (3) Subsetting on rows, both perm and span where applicable.
                      The system should naturally be expandable to 3D arrays.

NOT STARTED       (4) Error messages from within device code and other threads.

NOT STARTED       (5) L1 implementation to BLAS, Thrust and other future
                      subroutines (for example, using openBlas).

NOT STARTED       (6) Double precision numerical tensors.
