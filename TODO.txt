STARTED           (1) Unified way of handling dimensions, where 1D arrays
                      are not row/or column vectors. The system should naturally
                      be expandable to 3D arrays.

NOT STARTED       (2) Error messages from within device code and other threads.

NOT STARTED       (3) Subsetting on rows, both perm and span where applicable.
                      The system should naturally be expandable to 3D arrays.

NOT STARTED       (4) L1 implementation to BLAS, Thrust and other future
                      subroutines (for example, using openBlas).
