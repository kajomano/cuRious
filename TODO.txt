IN PROGRESS       (1) Unified way of handling dimensions and spans. The system
                      should naturally be expandable to 3D arrays.

NOT STARTED       (2) Subsetting on rows, both perm and span where applicable.
                      The system should naturally be expandable to 3D arrays.

NOT STARTED       (3) Error messages from within device code and other threads.

NOT STARTED       (4) L1 implementation to BLAS, Thrust and other future
                      subroutines (for example, using openBlas).

NOT STARTED       (5) Double precision numerical tensors.
